# discordbot

Bot written and "maintained" by me, Kename.

Bot currently has the ability to reply to certain messages and can lightly manage roles.

In the future the bot will be able to do more.
IE:
  Remove roles, 
  Manage users remotely (For Admins that is), 
  Have reccomendation feature, 
  Not break every 2 seconds, 












Just kill me please
